    <title>Numerical Expressions</title>
    <p>Suppose your kitchen sink has sprung a leak. You hire a plumber who charges a flat $50 service fee plus $75 per hour of labor. If the plumber works for 3 hours, how much will you owe?
    </p>
        
    <p>To calculate the total cost, you could write the following mathematical expression:
        <men xml:id="plumber-cost-numerical-expression">50 + 75 \cdot 3</men>
        Evaluating this gives the total cost of $275.
    </p>

    <p>The above expression <xref ref="plumber-cost-numerical-expression"/> is an example of a <term>numerical expression</term>. In this section, we will explore numerical expressions and the rules for evaluating them.
    </p>

    <definition xml:id="def-numerical-expression">
        <statement>
            <p>A <term>numerical expression</term> is an expression formed by combining <em>numbers</em> using the operations of arithmetic. Numerical expressions may also contain grouping symbols like parentheses (...).</p>
        </statement>
    </definition>
     <example xml:id="example-numerical-expressions">
       <p>The following are additional examples of numerical expressions:
        <md>
            <mrow>&amp; 5 + 3</mrow>
            <mrow>&amp; 10 + 7 \cdot 2</mrow>
            <mrow>&amp; (8-3)^2 + 6 \div 3</mrow>
            <mrow>&amp; 2 \cdot 3 + 4 \cdot 5 - 6 \div 2</mrow>
        </md>
        </p>
    </example>

    <p>Like all mathematical language, numerical expressions are powerful because they have a precise meaning that is independent of any particular problem they may model.
    </p>    
    <p>For example, suppose you were to hand your friend a slip of paper with just the above expression <xref ref="plumber-cost-numerical-expression"/> written on it. Without knowing anything about your plumbing problem, your friend should still be able to interpret and evaluate this expression to get the value of 275.
    </p>    
    <p>That is the power of mathematical language: it allows us to communicate ideas precisely and unambiguously.
    </p>  
    <p>Specifically, to correctly interpret a numerical expression requires that we apply the <term>order of operations</term>.
        These rules specify the proper order for combining the numbers that make up such expressions using the given arithmetic operations.
        In this way, every numerical expression can be evaluated to a unique value. 
    </p> 
    <definition xml:id="def-order-of-operations">
        <statement>
            <p>
                The <term>order of operations</term> gives the proper order to evaluate any numerical expression:
                <ol>
                    <li>First, evaluate any expressions inside parentheses (...) and other grouping symbols. Each expression within grouping symbols should be evaluated as if it were a separate expression using the same order of operations.</li>
                    <li>Then, evaluate exponents (powers and roots).</li>
                    <li>Then, perform multiplication and division from left to right.</li>
                    <li>Then, perform addition and subtraction from left to right.</li>
                </ol>
                The above order of operations can be remembered using the acronym <em>PEMDAS</em>, which stands for Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication/Division, Addition/Subtraction.
            </p>
        </statement>
    </definition>
    <example>
        <p> Use the order of operations to verify that the numerical expressions in <xref ref="example-numerical-expressions"/> above evaluate as follows:
        <md>
            <mrow>&amp; 5 + 3 \div 2 = 4</mrow>
            <mrow>&amp; 10 + 7 - 4 \cdot 5 \div 2 = 7</mrow>
            <mrow>&amp; (8-3)^2 + 6 \cdot 1 = 27 </mrow>
            <mrow>&amp; 2 \cdot 3 + 4 \cdot 5 - 6 \div 2 = 23</mrow>
        </md>

    <definition xml:id="def-algebraic-expression">
        <statement>
            <p>An <term>algebraic expression</term> is an expression formed by combining terms that are either <em>numbers</em> or the <em>product</em> of a number with one or more <em>variables</em>.</p>
        </statement>
    </definition>
    <note>
        <p>Algebraic expressions are thus a <term>generalization</term> of numerical expressions: a numerical expression is an algebraic expressionwithout that happens not to have any variable terms.</p>
    </note>
    <example xml:id="example-algebraic-expression">
        <p>The following are all algebraic expressions:
        <md>
            <mrow>&amp; x+1</mrow>
            <mrow>&amp; 2x+3y</mrow>
            <mrow>&amp; 4x^2-5x+2</mrow>
        </md>
        </p>
    </example>
        <aside>
        <p>In our early study, we focus on algebraic expressions formed using just addition, subtraction, multiplication, and exponentiation. Later on, we will form <term>rational expressions</term> by dividing one algebraic expression by another.</p>
        </aside>
        <p>Note that unlike numerical expressions, algebraic expressions containing variables do not have a unique value until the variabls are assigned a specific value.</p>
        <p>Therefore, algebraic expressions in general can only be evaluated when the values of the variables are known.</p>

        <p>Within an algebraic expression,  where a number is multiplied together with variables, the number is called the <term>coefficient</term> of that term. The coefficient is always written right before the variable part of the term.</p>
