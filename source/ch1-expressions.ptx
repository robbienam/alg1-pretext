    <title>Numerical Expressions</title>
    <p>A <term>numerical expression</term> is an expression formed by combining <em>numbers</em> using the operations of arithmetic. Numerical expressions may also contain grouping symbols like parentheses ().</p>
    <example xml:id="example-numerical-expression">
       <p>Consider the following numerical expressions:
        <md>
            <mrow>&amp; 5 + 3 \div 2</mrow>
            <mrow>&amp; 10 + 7 - 4 \cdot 5 \div 2</mrow>
            <mrow>&amp; (8-3)^2 + 6 \div 3</mrow>
            <mrow>&amp; 2 \cdot 3 + 4 \cdot 5 - 6 \div 2</mrow>
        </md>
        </p>
    </example>

    <p>Like all mathematical language, every numerical expression has a precise meaning. In this case, the expression's meaning is determined by the <term>order of operations</term>. These rules specify the proper order for combining the numbers in the expression. In this way, every numerical expression can be simplified or evaluated to a single number value.</p>

            <p>
                The <term>order of operations</term> is the set of rules that determines the proper order in which operations must be performed to evaluate a numerical expression. The order is as follows:

    <example>
        <p> The numerical expressions above evaluate as follows:
        <md>
            <mrow>&amp; 5 + 3 \div 2 = 4</mrow>
            <mrow>&amp; 10 + 7 - 4 \cdot 5 \div 2 = 7</mrow>
            <mrow>&amp; (8-3)^2 + 6 \cdot 1 = 27 </mrow>
            <mrow>&amp; 2 \cdot 3 + 4 \cdot 5 - 6 \div 2 = 23</mrow>
        </md>

    <title>Algebraic Expressions</title>
    <p>An <term>algebraic expression</term> is an expression formed by combining terms that are either <em>numbers</em> or the <em>product</em> of a number with one or more <em>variables</em>.</p>
    <note>
        <p>Algebraic expressions are thus a <term>generalization</term> of numerical expressions: a numerical expression is an algebraic expressionwithout that happens not to have any variable terms.</p>
    </note>
    <example xml:id="example-algebraic-expression">
        <p>The following are all algebraic expressions:
        <md>
            <mrow>&amp; x+1</mrow>
            <mrow>&amp; 2x+3y</mrow>
            <mrow>&amp; 4x^2-5x+2</mrow>
        </md>
        </p>
    </example>
        <aside>
        <p>In our early study, we focus on algebraic expressions formed using just addition, subtraction, multiplication, and exponentiation. Later on, we will form <term>rational expressions</term> by dividing one algebraic expression by another.</p>
        </aside>
        <p>Note that unlike numerical expressions, algebraic expressions containing variables do not have a unique value until the variabls are assigned a specific value.</p>
        <p>Therefore, algebraic expressions in general can only be evaluated when the values of the variables are known.</p>

        <p>Within an algebraic expression,  where a number is multiplied together with variables, the number is called the <term>coefficient</term> of that term. The coefficient is always written right before the variable part of the term.</p>
